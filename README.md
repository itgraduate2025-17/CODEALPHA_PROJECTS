# AI Chatbot using Groq

This is a simple AI chatbot project built using Python, Groq LLM, and Gradio.

## What it does
The chatbot allows you to chat with an AI.  
It takes your messages as input and generates intelligent responses using the Groq large language model.  
You can interact with it through a friendly web interface without using the console.

## How it is built
- Python: Handles the main logic of the chatbot  
- Groq LLM API: Generates responses for user input  
- Gradio: Creates an easy-to-use interface for chatting  
- The chatbot sends your messages to the model and displays the replies in real-time

## Usage
1. Run the chatbot.py file in Google Colab or your local environment  
2. Set your Groq API key in the code  
3. Start chatting through the Gradio interface

This project is a beginner-friendly AI application demonstrating API integration, Python programming, and basic UI development.
